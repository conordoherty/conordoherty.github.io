        <h2>0. Purpose of this page</h2>

        <p>The purpose of this page is to explain and demonstrate what the
        Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) is
        doing "under the hood" when applied to remotely sensed intra-annual time
        series. The main intended audience is remote sensing researchers who work
        with environmental time series data. However, researchers in other domains
        may also find it instructive (colleagues in
        other fields have told me it enhanced their understanding of the DFT).
        Throughout this page, remote sensing
        domain-specific content is limited to the running example of Normalized
        Difference Vegetation Index 
        (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_difference_vegetation_index" target="_blank">NDVI</a>)
        time series as proxy for vegetation development.
        The intention is for the presentation of material to be precise but 
        still accessible to a relatively broad audience.
        The information presented here can help
        readers decide whether and how the DFT can be effectively applied to
        their research problem.
        </p>

        <p>The motivation for this analysis is that intra-annual environmental time
        series are structurally different from the data to which the DFT is
        commonly applied in other fields. In signal processing, dynamical systems,
        or time series analysis more generally, the DFT is often used to process
        and analyze periodic
        data. Even if the data is not strictly periodic, often there is
        at least some notion of "cycles" and a given data sample will contain
        many complete cycles. In many intra-annual environmental time series, 
        there will be only a single "cycle". For example, measurements of an agricultural
        field containing a crop with a single growing season and harvest will complete 
        one cycle per year. Even when there is more than one cycle, for example in
        the tropics or a crop with multiple harvests, the number of cycles will
        still be small and the duration of each cycle will not necessarily be equal.
        </p>

        <p>This observation does not, in itself, imply that the DFT cannot
        or should not be applied to intra-annual environmental time series. After all:
        </p>

        <p class="quote">"One can Fourier transform anything — often meaningfully."
        <br />- John Tukey</p>

        <p>The issue is not that the DFT will necessarily distort
        the data. For example, application of a rank \(n\) forward then inverse
        DFT will
        exactly reconstruct a time series of length \(n\), regardless of periodicty
        (see Section 2).
        Rather, the issue is that the way the DFT is often used in remote sensing
        applications relies on the assumption that the data can be approximated 
        by a low-dimensional DFT-based representation without significant loss
        of information. This page will explore what can happen when this assumption
        does not hold in practice.
        </p>

        <p>Some specific goals of this page are the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide the mathematical background necessary to understand the
                underlying "mechanics" of what happens when the DFT is used for
                information extraction and data smoothing</li>
            <li>Demonstrate, with provided Python code, how to construct the DFT
                and numerically verify some of its important properties</li>
            <li>Build geometric intuition for the particular concerns that arise
                when applying the DFT to intra-annual environmental time
                series</li>
        </ul>

        <p>An important takeaway from this page will be an
        understanding of how the behavior of the DFT, applied to intra-annual time
        series, is determined by the particular frequency terms selected for the
        transformation. Put another way, it will become clear that
        there is not a canonical set of frequencies
        suited to the analysis of intra-annual environmental time series.
        (This is different from other techincal domains, where "the DFT"
        often refers to a set of consecutive integer frequencies
        up to some cutoff.) In practice, this means that the
        DFT should not be thought of as a generic data transformation in
        environmental remote sensing. Rather, its use should be informed by
        application-specific data. Failing to account for this fact
        can introduce bias and other distortions of the data across a range of
        applications.
        </p>

        <p>The motivation for creating this page came from working on the paper
        "Fisher Discriminant Analysis for Extracting Interpretable Phenological
        Information from Multivariate Time Series Data"
        (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31223/X5H94P" target="_blank">preprint</a>).
        Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) is a method of computing a linear
        transformation that maximally separates dissimilar data in the transformed
        space. As the paper explains, you can construct scenarios where the DFT is
        optimal with respect to the FDA criterion. However, these scenarios are
        unlikely to arise in real remotely sensed measurement time series.
        Neither the FDA paper nor this page claim to offer a comprehensive theory
        of how to approach the
        analysis of intra-annual time series. However, they do take steps toward
        developing a mathematical framework 
        for analyzing some of most widely studied objects in environmental
        remote sensing.
        </p>

        <p>The presentation of this material assumes 
        familiarity with concepts from linear algebra like basis, orthogonality,
        and projection. Example Python code is given to demonstrate various points,
        but understanding the code line-by-line is not required for understanding the high
        level concepts. The purpose of the code is to numerically verify some
        important properties of the DFT, rather than formally proving them.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Background on the use of the DFT in environmental remote sensing</h2>

        <p>The DFT is widely used in enviornmental remote sensing to process and
        analyze time series data. Despite its ubiquity, there has been relatively
        little written about the mathematical properties of the DFT 
        with respect to the particular kind of time series data that arise in
        environmental remote sensing. Many studies employ the DFT, or related methods,
        with little or no justification. Other studies dismiss it out of hand as
        inappropriate on the grounds that intra-annual environmental time series are
        not stationary. While the latter camp may be technically correct, it's
        also oversimplifying a subtle and at times messy issue. After all, many of
        the studies that have used the DFT for data smoothing, dimensionality
        reduction, and information extraction have attained (and published) good
        results across a range of applications. Even where the DFT isn't technically
        "the best tool for the job," decades of environmental remote sensing
        literature suggest that it is a tool that can often get the job done.
        </p>

        <p>This page will focus on two uses of the DFT that are common in
        environmental remote sensing: information extraction and data smoothing.
        These topics are closely related, differing primarily in terms of operating
        on a low-dimensional representation of a time series (information extraction)
        versus reconstructing the time series in its original dimension (smoothing).
        We will cover information extraction first because the role that choice
        of basis frequencies plays is most obvious in this context.
        Moving on to smoothing,
        we will examine how DFT-based smoothing filters can cause blurring of 
        "sharp" features in a time series. Blurring is indicative of a "loss
        of information" because there are features of the original time series
        that are not preserved in the reconstruction. The manner in which features
        of the original time series are preserved or distorted is determined by
        the choice of basis frequencies. In this way, information extraction and
        smoothing are two sides of the same method, and understanding one helps
        understand the other.
        </p>

        <p>Using the DFT for information extraction relies on the idea that
        a low-dimensional frequency domain representation of a time series
        encodes useful information about the object of study (e.g. the land surface).
        Variants of the basic approach are explained in Section 4. Studies that have
        used the DFT for information extracti include Adams et al. 2020,
        Dado et al. 2020, Deines et al. 2021, Filippelli et al. 2020,
        Geerken et al. 2005, Jakubauskas et al. 2002, Kluger et al. 2021,
        Moody and Johnson 2001,
        Wagenseil et al. 2006, Wang et al. 2019, Xun et al. 2021, You et al. 2021,
        and others.
        </p>

        <p>DFT-based smoothing, and time series smoothing in general, is performed
        to remove large changes over short periods of time. In some cases, it is
        assumed that the "true" time series has a certain degree of smoothness, such
        that sudden changes are likely to be caused by erroneous measurements that
        should be corrected. Smoothing can also be done for more pragmatic purposes to
        facilitate a data processing method, like fitting a curve of some
        fixed functional form to the time series (without necessarily claiming that
        the smoothed time series closer to the "truth"). Studies that have used the 
        DFT, or related methods like the Discrete Cosine Transform, for time
        series smoothing include Dash et al. 2010, Guan et al. 2014, Hermance 2007,
        Roerink et al. 2000, Urban et al. 2018, and others.
        </p>

        <p>
        While there is a wide
        range of methods
        used for both of these tasks (see Zeng et al. 2020 for a comprehensive review),
        it is worth examining the DFT due to its ubiquity and importance across
        a wide range of disciplines. Even where it is noted that the DFT
        may not be well-suited to analysis of remotely sensed time series
        (Martínez and Gilabert 2009),
        there has been relatively little technical exposition of the underlying
        mechanisms that determine how the DFT behaves when used to smooth or to
        extract information from intra-annual environmental time series.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Mathematical background on the DFT</h2>

        <p>There are various equivalent formulations of the DFT.
        We will consider the version expressed as a sum of cosine and sine
        functions with real-valued coefficients. This formulation is common in
        remote sensing literature and is closely related to a method called
        harmonic regression (HR).
        The "full" DFT decomposes a real-valued time series \(x(t)\),
        \(t = 1, \ldots , n\) (for simplicity assume \(n\) is even), into frequency
        components that complete some integer number \(k\) cycles per period.
        </p>

        <p>$$x(t) = a + \sum_{k=1}^{n/2-1} \left[ b_k \cos(2 \pi kt) + c_k \sin(2 \pi kt) \right] + d \cos \left(2 \pi \frac{n}{2} t \right) $$
        </p>

        <p>The constant \(a\) can be thought of as the "zero frequency" or the mean
        value of the time series. In standard formulations of the DFT, \(k\) takes
        only integer values. That is, each frequency component makes an integer
        number of complete cycles. The DFT is a projection onto a set of vectors
        corresponding to sinusoids of varying frequency.
        In practice, one will often want to use only a subset of the possible
        frequencies such that \( k &lt;e n/2 \).
        We can compute the vectors
        for a given set of frequencies using a function like the
        following:
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def make_hr_basis_funcs(n, freqs):
    basis_df = pd.DataFrame(data=np.arange(n)/n*(2*np.pi), columns=['ts'])
    basis_df['const'] = 1/np.sqrt(n)

    for freq in freqs:
        basis_df[f'cos{freq}'] = np.cos(freq*basis_df.ts)/np.sqrt(n)*np.sqrt(2)
        basis_df[f'sin{freq}'] = np.sin(freq*basis_df.ts)/np.sqrt(n)*np.sqrt(2)

    if freq == n//2-1 and n%2 == 0:
        basis_df[f'cos{freq+1}'] = np.cos((freq+1)*basis_df.ts)/np.sqrt(n)

    return basis_df</pre>

        <p>For example, when \( n = 16 \) the vectors corresponding to frequencies that
        complete 0, 1, and 2 cycles look like this:</p>
        <pre class="prettyprint">
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

basis = make_hr_basis_funcs(16, [1, 2])
for vec in basis.columns[1:]:
    plt.plot(basis[vec], label=vec)</pre>

        <img src="basis_funcs.png" class="plot" height=300px/>

        <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 1</strong> DFT basis vectors
        at integer frequencies. Note that all terms complete "full cycles"
        over the sample period.</p>

        <p>Note that these basis vectors are scaled to have unit length. (Unit-length
        scaling is merely a convention that will simplify some future calculations.)
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
np.linalg.norm(basis.const)
# 1.0

np.linalg.norm(basis.cos1)
# 1.0

np.linalg.norm(basis.sin1)
# 1.0
# ...</pre>

        <p>For integer values of \(k\), 
        <a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~stine/stat910/lectures/06_harmonic_regr.pdf" target="_blank">one can show analytically</a>
        that DFT basis
        vectors are orthogonal to one another.
        (Note that this is not the case for non-integer \(k\), which is a topic we
        will return to shortly.)
        In addition, the sum of the cosine and
        sine terms for a given frequency is orthogonal to the sum of terms in any
        other frequency. We can also check these properties numerically.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
np.allclose(np.dot(basis.cos1, basis.sin1), 0)
# True
# ...

np.allclose(np.dot(basis.cos1+basis.sin1, basis.cos2+basis.sin2), 0)
# True
# ...</pre>

        <p>Therefore the DFT vectors form an orthonormal basis. Viewed this way,
        the DFT 
        is simply a projection, the result of which gives the coordinates of the time
        series in "frequency space." Because the basis vectors have been scaled to
        unit length, we can easily compute the reconstruction of the time series
        after projection onto a given set of frequencies without additional scaling.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
# load NDVI time series data

        <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 2</strong> NDVI time series
        and a low rank reconstruction using a DFT-based projection.</p>

        <p>Note that the reconstructed time series does not exactly match the
        original because
        information is lost when projecting into a lower dimension (in this case,
        onto only two frequency modes plus a constant). Using more frequency terms
        will produce a more accurate reconstruction. In fact, if we use the "full"
        DFT with \(n/2\)  frequency terms for a time series with
        even length (\( n/2 - 1 \) for odd), then it is an \(n\)-dimensional
        orthonormal transformation (i.e. an isomorphism) and the time series will
        be reconstructed exactly. We can verify this property numerically.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">

ts_recon = dft@ts_freq
np.allclose(ts, ts_recon)
# True</pre>

        <p>Below, we can see the how the reconstruction of an NDVI time series varies
        as a function of the number of frequency terms used in the DFT. At one
        extreme, when we use only a constant term, the "reconstruction" is simply
        the mean of the time series. At the other extreme, the measurements are 
        reproduced exactly. You can also see that there are "diminishing
        returns" with respect to reconstruction error beyond about three frequency
        terms.

        the reconstruction error as a function of number of DFT terms.
        </p>

        <p>Up to this point, we have considered only frequencies that complete an
        integer number of cycles per period. This is, in general, necessary for
        orthogonality and is a standard practice in the analysis of periodic signals
        and other oscillatory dynamic systems. However, there are reasons why one
        might want to consider non-integer frequencies in an environmental remote
        sensing application, which we will examine next.</p>

        <h2>3. Harmonic regression with non-integer frequencies</h2>

        <p>Classical applications of the DFT deal with periodic signals that repeat
        many times over the duration of a sample. This is not the case with
        intra-annual environmental time series. For example, many crops and
        natural vegetation will complete a single "cycle" of development each year.
        For example, in the NDVI time series in the previous section, the observed
        vegetation density increases through the spring, peaks at some point in the 
        summer, and then recedes as the plants senesce.
        There are cases where vegetation can complete multiple cycles per
        year, such as multicropping or vegetation in the tropics. However, even these
        cases do not exhibit the same kind of harmonic oscillation that one finds in
        a radio wave, for example. Even though an NDVI time series sort of "looks
        like" a sinusoid, it cannot be reconstructed exactly using \(k \ll n/2\)
        frequency terms.
        </p>

        <p>In order to better represent a time series in low dimensions, it may
        be necessary to use non-integer frequencies. For example, the following 
        shows a basis composed of frequency terms that complete 0.75 and 1.5 
        oscillations per period.
        </p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
basis = make_hr_basis_funcs(len(ts), [.75, 1.5])

        <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 3</strong> DFT basis vectors
        at non-integer frequencies. Note that vectors are "mid-cycle"
        at the end of the sample period.</p>

        <p>We can check that the basis frequencies are no longer orthogonal to one
        another.</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">

# -0.2851111664886096</pre>

        <p>One impact of using a non-orthogonal basis is that the formulations of the
        DFT as a linear projection versus harmonic regression are no longer
        equivalent. Note that the Fourier coefficients computed by projection are
        not equivalent when using a non-orthogonal basis.</p>


        <pre class="prettyprint">
D = basis.iloc[:, 1:].to_numpy()

        <p>The reason for this difference is easy to see when considering
        for the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimator.</p>

        <p>$$ \left(D^TD \right)^{-1}D^Tx $$ </p>

        <p>When the DFT basis is orthonormal, then \( D^TD = I\), where \( I \) is the
        identity matrix. In this case, the OLS estimate of harmonic regression
        coefficients is simply \(D^T x \), which is equivalent to the projection
        formulation. When \( D^TD \neq I\), then projection and harmonic regression
        give different results.</p>

        <p>Already the claim that "there is no canonical set of frequencies for
        intra-annual environmental time series" should be starting to become
        apparent. Regression parameter estimates for non-orthogonal regressors
        depend on which other covariates are included in the regression specification
        (see the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisch%E2%80%93Waugh%E2%80%93Lovell_theorem" target="blank">
        Frish-Waugh-Lovell theorem</a> or, equivalently,
        <a href="https://hastie.su.domains/Papers/ESLII.pdf#page=73" target="_blank">
        regression by successive orthogonalization</a>). This means that the harmonic
        regression representation and/or reconstruction of the time series changes
        as non-orthogonal basis elements are added or removed. Therefore, the selection of
        basis elements must either be informed by prior knowledge or determined
        using application-specific data. In the following sections, we will examine
        how the utility of the DFT is determined by the choice of specific basis
        elements.</p>

        <h2>4. DFT for information extraction</h2>

        <p>One of the common uses of the DFT in remote sensing research is to
        extract information from time series ("engineer features" in machine
        learning terminology). In this context, the DFT is used most commonly
        for time series classification problems, like identifying crop or land
        cover types. However, in principle, it could be used to predict time
        series labels of any kind including realizations of a continuous variable
        (i.e. regression).
        </p>

        <p>The logic underlying this approach is that the
        representation of the time series in the frequency domain encodes useful
        information. Employing this approach generally assumes that the time series
        can be usefully described using relatively few frequency terms. Each frequency
        term adds two dimensions to the frequency domain representation.
        </p>

        <p>In practice, this type of method is used in two ways. The first is to take
        the coordinates in the frequency domain (i.e. the cosine/sine coefficient
        estimates in a harmonic
        regression) as abstract features to be passed to a machine learning model.
        This approach allows for using multiple frequency terms and multivariate time
        series, but can be less interpretable depending on the number of features
        and the type of machine learning model used. The second approach
        is to explicity compute the amplitude \(A\) and initial phase \(\varphi\) at a
        given frequency. For example, at frequency \(k\) these can be computed as
        follow.
        </p>

        <p>$$ A_k = \sqrt{b_k^2 + c_k^2}$$
        $$\varphi_k = \arctan \left(\frac{c_k}{b_k} \right)$$
        </p>

        <p>The amplitude and initial phase may be useful for various time series labelling
        problems. For example, the amplitude of an NDVI time series roughy estimates
        the difference between the maximum and minimum vegetation density, which can
        be useful for distinguishing between different types of vegetation with
        different canopy structure. The initial phase gives information on the timing
        of changes in vegetation density, such as green-up or senescence.</p>

        <p class="figure-label"><strong>Interactive Figure 2</strong>
        Relationship between initial phase and planting day of year (DOY) as a
        function of frequency. The lefthand plot shows a cosine with the
        frequency \(f\) corresponding to the number of oscillations per period
        selected on
        the frequency slider. The translucent line plots are real county-average
        NDVI time series, where the color corresponds to the average corn planting
        date. The righthand plot shows county average planting date versus initial
        phase, where the intial phase is computed by projecting the county-average
        NDVI time series onto Fourier mode of frequency \(f\) and using the 
        formula for \(\varphi\) above.
        </p>

        <p>The visualization above makes it clear that the correlation between
        planting date and initial phase depends strongly on the selected frequency.
        For example, at the frequency of 1, there is a clear relationship between
        planting date and initial phase. However, some of the later planting dates
        "go off the top" of the plot and
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliasing" target="_blank">alias</a>
        back in at negative phase values.
        By toggling the frequency slider, you can find frequencies where initial phase
        appears to be a good predictor of planting date. However, there is no way
        to know what these frequencies will be <i>a priori</i>. Rather, they must
        be found using labelled data. In practice, one must also keep in mind that
        adding and removing non-orthogonal frequencies will affect the frequency
        domain representation of the time series when using HR.
        </p>

        <h2>5. DFT for smoothing</h2>

        <p>The DFT is also used for time series smoothing, either in an attempt
        to better approximate the hypothetical "true" time series or simply to
        facilitate and additional data processing step like curve fitting.
        As mentioned in Section 1, DFT-based smoothing is closely related to
        information extraction and relies on the same basic assumption that
        the time series can be usefully approximated using a low-dimensional
        frequency domain representation. This section will focus on how DFT-based
        smoothers cause blurring of sharp features, which may cause useful information
        to be lost.
        </p>

        <p>The projection and reconstruction operations shown in Section 2 are
        equivalent to applying a 
        "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinc_filter#Brick-wall_filters" target="_blank">brick-wall</a>"
        low pass filter. A low pass filter allows the low
        frequencies to pass through and blocks the high frequencies, which are
        assumed to be noise. In the frequency domain, the filter used to generate the
        reconstruction in <b>Figure 2</b> looks like a rectangular step function with
        a sharp cutoff above which frequencies are removed.

        <p>From the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem" target="_blank">Convolution Theorem</a>,
        we know that multiplication in the frequency domain is equivalant to
        convolution in the time domain. It is instructive to verify this property
        numerically, although it involves more technical details than previous
        examples. These details are mentioned but mostly glossed over because
        they are not integral to the geometric intuition.</p>

        <pre class="prettyprint">
# recreate the basis used in Figure 2
basis = make_hr_basis_funcs(ts.size, [1, 2])

# construct the sinc fuction as the inverse transform of the filter
# (it's easier to think about using the complex formulation of the DFT,
# where the non-zero brick-wall filter coefficients are 1+0i, resulting in
# the inverse transform producing a sum of only the real-valued i.e. cosine
# frequency terms)
# (note also the scaling of cosine terms by sqrt 2 to account for how we
# originally scaled the DFT basis vectors)
sinc = basis.const+(basis.cos1+basis.cos2)*np.sqrt(2)

# center the sinc function
# (otherwise convolution will produce a shifted version of the filtered
# time series)

        <p>The inverse transform of a continuous box-shaped step function is
        known as the sinc function and is given by the formula \( \sin(t)/t \). 
        With a time-domain representation of the filter, we can now apply it
        using a convolution. Note that the projection/reconstruction and
        convolution formulations produce identical filtered time series.
        </p>
        
        <pre class="prettyprint">
# the numpy and scipy `convolve` functions do not have an option for circular
# convolution, so we will simply repeat the time series three times, convolve
# with the filter, and then keep the "middle" copy of the time series
# (circular convolution is generally implemented via DFT, but the whole point
# is we're trying to demonstrate that they're equivalent)

# create "triple" repeated time series
tts = np.tile(ts, 3)

# convolve with filter and keep only the "middle"
ts_filt = np.convolve(tts, sinc, mode='same')[ts.size:-ts.size]

np.allclose(ts_filt, ts_recon)
# True
</pre>

        <p>Reframing the projection/reconstruction as a convolution makes
        it is easier to see how the low pass
        filter smooths the time series. Considering the
        sinc function in <strong>Figure 4</strong> as a
        convolution kernel, the filtering operation computes a weighted
        average at each measurement in the time series. The "lobes" of the sinc 
        function capture nearby values in the weighted average. 
        This is why the filter 
        smooths the time series, but also "flattens out" sharp features.
        The effect is similar to blurring of an image by a low pass filter
        in two dimensions, as shown in <strong>Figure 5</strong>.</p>

        <div class="loop">
            <img src='loopdee_square.jpeg' height=260px/>
            <img src='loopdee_fuzzy.jpeg' height=260px style="float: right"/>
        </div>

        <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 5</strong> Original (left) and
        smoothed/blurred (right) images of my dog. The filter used is a 2D brick-wall
        low pass filter. The filtered image also contains
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringing_artifacts" target="_blank">ringing artifacts</a>.</p>

        <p>Similar to the blurring of edges of objects in the image, the low
        pass filter smooths/blurs sharp features in a one dimensional time series.
        In some applications, like studies of vegetation phenology, certain sharp
        features of the time series are the primary interest. For example, "green-up"
        is commonly identified as the point where NDVI (or similar measurement) 
        goes from relatively flat to sharply increasing as leaves and other
        biomass develop. As we see in the lefthand plot of
        <strong>Figure 6</strong>, a smoothing
        filter can make green-up seem much more gradual and make it difficult
        to identify a specific date where it begins.
        The righthand plot in <strong>Figure 6</strong> shows the reconstruction
        error. Note that some of the
        largest point errors occur around green-up and just prior to peak
        vegetation density (both are phenological "events" of interest).
        This examples shows how blurring around critical points could meaningfully
        alter the results of a
        vegetation phenology study.
        </p>

        <img src="blurred_greenup.png" class="plot" height=240px />
        <p class="figure-label"><strong>Figure 6</strong> "Blurred" green up (left)
        and reconstruction error (right). The smoothing filter is the 1-dimensional
        version of the brick wall filter applied to the image in
        <strong>Figure 5</strong>. Note that the largest reconstruction errors
        (or "residuals" in regression terminology) occur around sharp features
        of the time series, where NDVI values change quickly.
        </p>

        <p>The effect of blurring, combined with other issues like aliasing, can
        distort features in the smoothed time series. For example, supposed we
        are trying to identify when green-up begins using NDVI time series. The
        lefthand plot in <strong>Figure 7</strong> contains two NDVI time series
        that, on
        visual inspection, appear to be virtually identical during the green-up
        period from timesteps 7-12. However, we see that the reconstructed time
        series in the righthand plot are noticeably different over this same period.
        While the difference my initially seem small, it can lead to nontrivial
        differences in when green-up appears to occur. Time series 2 (orange)
        still appears
        to begin green-up around timestep 7, even in the righthand plot. It is
        less clear where green-up begins in the smoothed time series 1 (blue).
        Depending on
        the method one chooses to identify green-up, it could plausibly start
        anywhere between timesteps 3 and 10 based on the smoothed time series.
        Given that remotely sensed measurements are
        often separated by several days or even weeks, this smoothing could
        significantly
        alter an estimate of the timing of green-up or another phenological event.

        <h2>6. Conclusions and takeaways</h2>

        <p>This page covers many details regarding the application of the DFT
        to intra-annual time series. As stated in the introduction, the purpose
        of the page
        is not to suggest that the DFT is inherently unsuited
        to processing and analyzing intra-annual time series. However, it does
        make the point that the DFT is not a "generic" transformation in this
        context. Poor choice of basis frequencies can result in loss of
        application-relevent information or, equivalently, blurring of features
        of interest that were present in the original time series.
        </p>

        <p>As mentioned in Section 0, an alternative to DFT-based information
        extraction is Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA). Doherty and Mauter
        (<a href="https://doi.org/10.31223/X5H94P" target="_blank">preprint</a>)
        explain the connection between FDA and the DFT. Under specific
        conditions, when the structure of a time series is invariant to
        translation in time, the DFT will be "optimal" for information extraction
        with respect to the FDA criterion. However, it is very unlikely
        for this situation to arise with real intra-annual environmental time series.
        In practice, the interpretation of a given measurement often depends strongly
        on what time of year the measurement was taken (i.e. not translation
        invariance). The exposition on this page has hopefully helped build some
        intuition for why this is the case, and why it can be beneficial to look
        "beyond" DFT-based methods for information extraction and data smoothing
        when analyzing intra-annual environmental time series.</p>
