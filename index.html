        <p>I am a PhD candidate in environmental engineering at Stanford University.
        I am a member of the
        <a href="https://we3lab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">WE3 Lab</a>
        and my advisor is Professor Meagan Mauter. I was a 
        <a href="https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program" target="_blank">Stanford Data Science Scholar</a>
        in 2020-2021.
        </p>

        <p>In my research I use satellite remote sensing
        to analyze agricultural practices with a focus on irrigation.
        I do some applied work developing and evaluating methods of
        estimating evapotranspiration for applications like irrigation scheduling and water management.
        In this capacity, I have contributed to the
        <a href="https://openetdata.org/" target="_blank">OpenET</a> and
        <a href="https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-barc/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/hydrology-and-remote-sensing-laboratory/docs/grapex/grapex-home/" target="_blank">GRAPEX</a> projects.
        I also do some more theoretical work related to mathematical modeling of
        remotely sensed environmental time series data.
        In addition to my primary research areas, I am interested in scientific
        computing, signal processing, and data science.
