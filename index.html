        <h1>Conor T. Doherty</h1>
        <img src="web_pic.jpg" class="main-photo" />
        <p>I am a Remote Sensing Research Scientist employed by [the University Corporation at]
        <a href="https://csumb.edu/aes/" target="_blank">Cal State Monterey Bay</a>. I work at
        NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) in the Biospheric Science Branch under the
        <a href="https://www.arc-crest.org/">ARC-CREST</a> agreement. I was previously a
        <a href="https://npp.orau.org/about/index.html" target="_blank">NASA Postdoctoral Program</a> (NPP)
        fellow affiliated with the
        <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-earth-exchange-nex/" target="_blank">NASA Earth Exchange</a>.
        I did a PhD in environmental engineering at Stanford University
        (graduated March 2023), where I was a member of the
        <a href="https://we3lab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank">WE3 Lab</a>. I was a 
        <a href="https://datascience.stanford.edu/programs/stanford-data-science-scholars-program" target="_blank">Stanford Data Science Scholar</a>
        in 2020-2021. I also have a MS in public policy and management
        from Carnegie Mellon and a BS in mathematics from Stanford.
        Between undergrad and grad school, I worked at
        <a href="https://www.singlestore.com/" target="_blank">SingleStore</a>
        (fka MemSQL).</p>

        <p>I contribute to <a href="https://openetdata.org/" target="_blank">OpenET</a>,
        for which I am currently working on partitioning evapotranspiration (ET) into ET of precipitation versus
        ET of applied water (i.e., irrigation). My NPP project focused on statistical
        methods for quantifying uncertainty in interpolated near-surface meteorological data products.
        During my PhD, I worked on various theoretical and applied topics in remote sensing of agriculture and irrigation.
        I have written many thousands of lines
        of Python but I am now a vociferous advocate for <a href="https://julialang.org/" target="_blank">Julia</a>.</p>
